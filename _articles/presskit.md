### Short description

The tactical RPG going full Goblin mode!
Hire a band of almost-heroic goblins to fight and die for you in tactical turn-based battles, accomplish silly quests for the weird inhabitants of this fantastic world, and truly become a god - at least by goblin standards.

### Game overview

At its core, Gobs and Gods is a *Tactical RPG*:

- You freely explore a procedural 2D fantasy world.
- You hire, level up, and equip a small troupe of Goblins.
- You engage in fights on a tactical hexagonal grid. These fights are turn-based but can be switched to real-time.
- You complete random quests for the local villagers and follow a unique main quest.

This "classical" gameplay has a major *twist*: 
Main inhabitants of this world are Goblins, and you are one of their Gods.
- Quests have delightfully absurd dialogs.
- Your goblins have colorful character traits (Incontinent, Coquettish, Monomaniac, ...) which all impact the gameplay.
- Being a God, you receive compensation when your hired goblins die, unlocking new powers.
