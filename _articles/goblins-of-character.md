In Gobs and Gods, each Goblin you hire is unique, with its own stats, skills, and archetype. Additionally, they possess two traits that define their character. 
Of course, these are *Goblins* traits, so you should not expect to find boring traits like *heroic* or *reliable*. Instead, examples of goblin traits include *Greedy*, *Chicken Hearted*, *Unstylish*, or also *Monomaniac*, *Incontinent* ... 
Obviously, all of these are defects, but most will be accompanied by a small hidden bonus. Making the best of your goblins despite themselves will be part of the fun!

Here Gobibet is *Greedy* and *Werewolf Poser*. *Greedy* means that he will categorically refuse to let down his equipement, unless you replace it with a higher level item. 
Think twice before equiping him with your best weapon!
