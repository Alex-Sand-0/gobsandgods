<h2> Alexandre Gilotte</h2>
After teaching math for a few years, I transitioned to the adtech industry and spent 10 years enhancing machine learning models at Criteo, initially as a developer and later as a researcher. Recently, I made the decision to dedicate an entire year to work exclusively on 'Gobs & Gods' as the sole developer.

<h2> Thierry Gilotte</h2>  
After hesitating for a long time between studying art and engineering, I eventually pursued both, and now work as an art teacher. I began drawing Goblins almost 20 years ago for a board game prototype which was already called 'Gobs and Gods.' I am now creating all the artwork for 'Gobs' in my free time.
