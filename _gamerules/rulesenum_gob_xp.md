Your goblins gain [[img=<32>x<32>]res://ressources/myimages/ui/emojilike/gobxp.png[/img]] after each battle or when completing a quest, and willl [Level Up]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-level-up.html' | relative_url }}) when they reach the [Required XP]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-required-xp.html' | relative_url }}) for the next level. They also get some [Initial xp]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-initial-xp.html' | relative_url }}) when you hire them. When a gob dies, his accumulated [[img=<32>x<32>]res://ressources/myimages/ui/emojilike/gobxp.png[/img]] is converted to [GodXP]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-godxp.html' | relative_url }}).
