When a gob reaches the [Required XP]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-required-xp.html' | relative_url }}) for the next level, he can picks a bonus. Level up bonuses are either skills (on odd levels) or stats (on even levels, or when there is no skill the gob can learn). Stats level ups above level 20 gives only a minor stat increase.
