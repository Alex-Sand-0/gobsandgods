The success probability of a range attack depends on the difference between the attacker [Range Score]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-rangescore.html' | relative_url }}) and the defender [Range Defense]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-rangedefense.html' | relative_url }}). It is also modified by the distance between the attacker and defender and their respective [Height]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-height.html' | relative_url }}), and by eventual obstacles between them.
