During the night, your gobs regenerate their [Essence]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-essence.html' | relative_url }}) and you can directly cast [Spells]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-spells.html' | relative_url }}) in combat. However the goblins do not regenerate their [Health]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-health.html' | relative_url }}), and the bonuses from [Defender]Defender and [Assault]Assault become inactive.
