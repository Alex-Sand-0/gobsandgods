A gob whose remaining [Health]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-health.html' | relative_url }}) is less than 60% of his [Max Health]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-maxhealth.html' | relative_url }}) gets the hurt status, and suffers a malus to most of his stats. Below 30%, he becomes badly hurt, and the malus is doubled.
