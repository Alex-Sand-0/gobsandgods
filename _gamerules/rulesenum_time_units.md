'Time units' measure a gob's time spent in combat actions.
In turn by turn, a Gob can take any action as long as it has at least one remaining time unit.
Starting a long action at the turn's end reduces available time units for the next turn.

The number of time units available each turn depends on the Gob's [Speed]({{ 'stats/statenum-speed.html' | relative_url }}).
