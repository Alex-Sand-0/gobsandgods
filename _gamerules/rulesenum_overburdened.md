When a gob [Encumbrance]({{ 'derivedstats/otherstatenum-encumbrance.html' | relative_url }}) exceeds his [Max Encumbrance]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-maxencumbrance.html' | relative_url }}), he becomes overburdened and gets a malus to his [Move Time Modifier]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-movetimemodifier.html' | relative_url }}) and [Time Units Duration Factor]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-actionpointdurationfactor.html' | relative_url }}).
