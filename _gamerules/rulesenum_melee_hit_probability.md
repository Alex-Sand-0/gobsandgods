The success probability of a melee attack depends on the difference between the attacker [Melee Score]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-meleescore.html' | relative_url }}) and the defender [Melee Defense]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-meleedefense.html' | relative_url }}). It is also modified by the respective [Height]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-height.html' | relative_url }}) of the attacker and defender, and by the number of enemies adjacent to the defender.
