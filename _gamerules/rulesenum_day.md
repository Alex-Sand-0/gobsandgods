During the day, your gobs regenerate their [Health]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-health.html' | relative_url }}) and the [Defender]Defender and [Assault]Assault god skills become active. But you cannot cast [Spells]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-spells.html' | relative_url }}) and your gobs do not regenerate their [Essence]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-essence.html' | relative_url }}).
