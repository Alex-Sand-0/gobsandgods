When a gob's health drops to zero he dies. Additionally, it receives the [Hurt]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-hurt.html' | relative_url }}) status when his health falls below 60% of [Max Health]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-maxhealth.html' | relative_url }}) and becomes badly hurt below 30%. Your gobs regenerate their health during the [Day]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-day.html' | relative_url }}), or when you [Feed]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-feed.html' | relative_url }}) them.
