Feeding your gobs restores most of their [Health]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-health.html' | relative_url }}) and some of their [Essence]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-essence.html' | relative_url }}). It also removes the [Hungry]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-hungry.html' | relative_url }}) status. You can feed them using the 'tent' icon if you have meat available, or by purchasing food from an [Innkeeper]Innkeeper.
