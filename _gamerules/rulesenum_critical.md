Some attacks have a [probability]({{ 'derivedstats/otherstatenum-criticalproba.html' | relative_url }}) to land a Critical hit, which means strongly increased [damages]({{ 'derivedstats/otherstatenum-criticaldamagesincrease.html' | relative_url }}). Critical probability is decreased by armor, but may be strongly increased when the attacker is in [Backstabbing]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-backstabbing.html' | relative_url }}) position.
