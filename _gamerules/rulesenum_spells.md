You can learn powerful spells when exploring the mage towers, which you can cast in combat during the [Night]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-night.html' | relative_url }}). Each spell is also associated to one of the 8 [Moon]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-moon.html' | relative_url }}), and will be cheaper and more powerful when the right moon is active.
