**Gobs and Gods** is an indie tactical RPG where you can freely [explore a fantastic world]( {{ 'exploring-the-world.html' | relative_url }}) full of magic and wonders.
The bad news: its nicest inhabitants are ... [Goblins]( {{ 'goblins-of-character.html' | relative_url }}#maincontent). 
The good news: they believe you are their God.

Hire a team of almost-good-for-nothing goblins to fight for you in [tactical turn-based combats]( {{ 'fast-tactical-turn-combats.html' | relative_url }}#maincontent), complete [delightfully absurd quests]({{'truly-epic-quests.html' | relative_url}}), [grow your godly powers]({{'godly-powers.html' | relative_url}}#maincontent)
, ... and find your way out of this crazy world!
