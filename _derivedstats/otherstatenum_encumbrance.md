Current weight carried by a gob. When it becomes larger then its [Max Encumbrance]({{ 'derivedstats/derivedstatenum-maxencumbrance.html' | relative_url }}), the gob becomes [Overburdened]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-overburdened.html' | relative_url }}). Encumbrance may be reduced by some skills such as [HeavyArmor]({{ 'skills/skillenum-heavyarmor.html' | relative_url }}) or [LightArmor]({{ 'skills/skillenum-lightarmor.html' | relative_url }}).
