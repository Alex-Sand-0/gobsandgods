 Determines how much times a gob spends when using one [Time Units]({{ 'gamerules/rulesenum-time-units.html' | relative_url }}).
 Base value is 100, a higher value means that the gob acts faster and thus has more time units available per round.
 Modified by [Speed]({{ 'stats/statenum-speed.html' | relative_url }}) and [Encumbrance]({{ 'derivedstats/otherstatenum-encumbrance.html' | relative_url }}).
