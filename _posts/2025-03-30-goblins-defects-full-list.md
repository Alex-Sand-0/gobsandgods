(Note: I rebalanced sligtly a few defects before writting this post, and the effects below may be slightly different from the current version on steam. They reflect the effects of the defect in the next patch, incoming... soon! )   
 

### Boring
   [i]Goballette is just boring. Other gobs avoid talking to him because he lacks character. And it is quite true, he does not even have 2 personal defects as other 'interesting' gobs do.[/i]
   Does nothing. A boring gob will get no other defect.

   Prevents wearing Heavy Boots or Heavy Body armor.

### Coquettish
   [i]Goballette the Beggar has a very strong and personal opinion on which items are 'fancy', and will refuse to wear anything which does not strictly match his tastes.[/i]
   A gob will this defect will refuse to equip some items he does not like. He will refuses about half (randomly) of the items of level 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10. He will always accept an item with an upgrade. He will also accpet any item when his mood is highest, but equiping an item he does not like lowers his mood.

### Unstylish

### Exhibitionist
   [i]Goballette the Beggar feels compulsed to show everyone his intimate parts, and will sometimes drop his armor at the beginning of a fight. On the bright side, this might sometimes scare away impressionable opponents.[/i]
   A gob will this defect will sometimes drop part of his armor at the start of a fight, but receive a large moral boost when doing so. The probability this triggers is higher when the gob is in bad mood.

### Monomaniac
   [i]Goballette the Beggar seems very, very focused on [url=skill:Dagger][color=yellow]Dagger[/color][/url]. He never talks about anything else, and will not learn any other skills.[/i]

### Greedy
   [i]Goballette the Beggar will refuse to let go of his belongings unless you offer him higher-level items.[/i]

### Straggler
   [i]Goballette the Beggar always dragging his feet, and he is always late on the battlefield. On the bright side, he also less likely to fall into an ambush.[/i]

### Dumb
   [i]Goballette the Beggar is just dumb. Yes, dumb *for a gob*. So don't try to teach him magic or speaking, you would only be disappointed. But never mind that, he at least understands the concept of 'hitting the other guy untils he stops moving'[/i]
   This defect prevents the gob from learning a large list of skills. But it increases the Melee Score by 3. On level up, if the gob cannot learn any new skill, he will get a stat upgrade instead.

### Boastful
   [i]If you believe Goballette the Beggar, he single-handedly defeated three trolls only two days ago, and sent running a pack of bullorcs the day before. And that's just the beginning. Maybe you should not trust too much his judgement when evaluating a foe.[/i]
   A gob with this defect will provide inacurate estimation of the danger level of an enemy mob.
