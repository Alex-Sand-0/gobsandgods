## Gobs and Gods have been released since 3 months already

And while the sales do not allow me to continue full-time, we have gathered a good amount of feedback from Discord and the Steam page. I have been working a lot in my free time since this summer to patch the reported issues and add quality-of-life features that were commonly requested by the community. The easy or urgent patches seem to be mostly behind us, and we can now think about the next steps.

In the coming months, there are two main areas Thierry and I want to focus on to continue improving the game:
- Improving the game balance and allowing better difficulty tuning
- Adding new content.

### Game balance and difficulty tuning

Some important feedback we received is that some players found the game a bit too easy, while others were happy with the difficulty level.
We have already made a few balance patches to fix the most broken skills and correct the end-game mobs, which were not challenging enough. We are now working on the next balance patch, which will require more time to test and finalize. 
  
But while discussing with the players asking for more challenge, it seems one key aspect is that the game puts little time pressure on the player. However some players strongly prefer the current low-pressure state.
To solve these different requests, we consider adding an option for the level of "pressure". The details are still a work in progress however. 

  
### Adding more content

We have a few quests we did not have time to finish writing properly for the release, which we decided to postpone. 
There is also a batch of new items, and the "Alchimecanic" skill, which will allow to use the weird but powerful abilities of some new "half-magic, half-technological items.
Finally, we also plan to make several "game start" options, each with a different bonus, malus, and starting goblins, to increase the replayability of Gobs.
